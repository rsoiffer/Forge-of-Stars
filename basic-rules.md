Following are some common rules for the game.

## Skill Rolls

Whenever you want to accomplish a task that has a possibility of failing, such as jumping across a large gap or attacking an enemy, the GM will ask you to make a **skill roll**. For example, you might make a Stealth roll to hide from sight, a Engineering roll to repair a spaceship, or a Survival roll to forage for food in the wild. If no [skill](skills.html) fits the action you want to take, the GM might ask you to make a roll for an [attribute](attributes.html) instead. For example, you might make a Strength roll to hold a door closed or an Intelligence roll to solve a logic puzzle. The GM also sets a **Difficulty Class** (DC) for the task. Some sample DCs are given in the Sample Difficulties table below.

How good you are at a task is described by your **bonus** to that roll. For skill rolls, your bonus is your score in the associated attribute, plus your [Prof](character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats) if you're proficient in that skill. A few rolls, such as [Initiative](character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats) rolls, are not associated with skills or attributes, but give another stat to use as your bonus instead. Some items or abilities may add additional bonuses or penalties to this value.

When you make a skill roll, roll a d20 and add your bonus, and record the result. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC, then your roll is a **success**. If your result is equal to or greater than the DC + 10, then your roll is instead a **critical success**. If your result is lower than the DC, then your roll is a **failure**. If your result is lower than the DC - 10, then your roll is instead a **critical failure**. These four categories are known as the **levels of success**. They are ordered, from best to worst, as **critical success > success > failure > critical failure**. If you roll a 20 on the die, then your result is one level of success higher than it would normally be. If you roll a 1 on the die, then your result is one level of success lower than it would normally be.

## Turns in Combat

Characters take turns during combat, as who acts first can be very important. When a fight breaks out, everyone involved rolls a d20 and adds their [Initiative](character-creation.html#step-7-compute-miscellaneous-stats) score. The character with the highest initative result takes their turn first, then the character with the second-highest initative result, and so on. Once all characters have taken their turns, the round ends, and the process repeats.

On your turn, you can take 3 actions. An action is a single thing your character does, such as [moving a distance](basic-powers.html#stride), [opening a door](basic-powers.html#interact), or [making a single attack](basic-powers.html#strike). In addition, you can take 1 reaction per round, either on your turn or another character's turn. You get your reaction back at the start of your turn. 

Using a special ability usually requires using one or more actions, or one reaction, indicated in its description. Some abilities might let you do multiple things in 1 action, or others might require you use multiple actions in exchange for a stronger effect. 

## Attacking

Player characters are often involved in armed combat against enemies. When any character wants to make an attack with a [weapon](weapons.html), they follow the rules below.

### Attack Rolls
Every weapon is associated with a particular skill, such as Melee Weapons for a laser sword or Heavy Weapons for a blaster rifle. When you attack, make a special skill roll (called an **attack roll**) with the skill associated with the weapon you're attacking with. The DC for this skill roll is your target's AC. On a failure or critical failure, your attack misses or is blocked, and has no effect on your target. On a success, your attack is a hit and deals damage. On a critical success, your attack is a critical hit and deals double damage.

### Damage Rolls
When you hit an attack, you deal damage to your target. Your attack's damage and damage type are listed in the weapon's stat block. If you're making a melee attack, note the attribute you added to the attack roll, and add this attribute as a bonus to the attack's damage. If you're making a ranged attack, **do not** add this attribute to the attack's damage. Compute the total damage, and subtract this value from your target's HP.

## Saving Throws

The three skills {% ref Fortitude %}, {% ref Reflex %}, and {% ref Will %} represent your character's ability to avoid or resist various types of attacks. Skill rolls made with these skills are called **saves** or **saving throws**. Unless otherwise specified, a saving throw against a damaging effect does the following.

**Critical Success:** You take no damage from the effect

**Success:** You take half the listed damage from the effect

**Failure:** You take the full damage listed from the effect

**Critical Failure:** You take double the listed damage from the effect

## Inspiration

The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration. A player can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll that any character makes.

## Gaining Levels

In Forge of Stars, characters level up whenever the GM feels that it is appropriate to do so. This should generally occur once for every 5 - 10 hours of real-life game time. To ensure balanced gameplay, all characters in the party should be the same level.

Leveling up an existing character is as simple as updating the character's stats in a similar way as creating the character. Every level, you put one point into a power school of your choice, and you learn one power from that school. Every odd level, you learn a ribbon of your choice, and every even level, you get either an ASI or a feat. Your HP increases by 5. Other stats, such as your Prof or your AC, might increase as well.
