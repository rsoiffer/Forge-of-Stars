Rage:
  type: 1-Action, Encounter
  traits: [Concentrate, Emotion, Mental]
  tags:
    duration:
      1 minute, until you can't sense any enemies, or until you fall unconscious
  effect:
    You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain temporary HP equal
    to your level + CON. While raging, you deal 2 additional damage with melee
    strikes, you take a -1 penalty to AC, and you can't use actions with <span
    class="trait">Concentrate</span> unless they also have <span
    class="trait">Rage</span>.

Sudden Charge:
  type: 2-Action, Encounter
  traits: [Flourish, Open]
  effect:
    With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If
    you end your movement within reach of at least one enemy, you can make a
    melee Strike against that enemy.

Power Attack:
  type: 2-Action, At-Will
  traits: [Flourish]
  effect:
    You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but
    leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike (which counts as two
    attacks when calculating your MAP). If this Strike hits, you deal an extra
    die of weapon damage.
