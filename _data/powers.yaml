# Berserker powers

Power Attack:
  tier: Novice
  type: 2-Action, At-Will
  traits: [Flourish]
  effect:
    You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but

    attacks when calculating your MAP). If this Strike hits, you deal an extra
    die of weapon damage.

Rage:

  type: 1-Action, Encounter
  brief: You enter a furious rage, gaining offensive power at the cost of defense
  traits: [Concentrate, Emotion, Mental]
  tags:
    duration:
      1 minute, until you can't sense any enemies, or until you fall unconscious
  effect:
    You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain temporary HP equal
    to your level + CON. While raging, you deal 2 additional damage with melee
    strikes, you take a -1 penalty to AC, and you can't use actions with <span
