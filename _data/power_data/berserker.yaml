Brutish Shove:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Press]
  tags:
    requirements: You are wielding a two-handed melee weapon
  effect: |
    Throwing your weight behind your attack, you hit your opponent hard enough to make it stumble back. Make a Strike with a two-handed melee weapon. If you hit a target that is your size or smaller, that creature is flat-footed until the end of your current turn, and you can automatically apply the effects of the Shove action (including the critical success effect, if your Strike was a critical hit). If you move to follow the target, your movement doesn't trigger reactions.

    This Strike has the following failure effect.
  failure: The target becomes flat-footed until the end of your current turn

Mountain Stance:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Stance]
  tags:
    requirements: You are unarmored and touching the ground
  effect: |
    You end the stance of an implacable mountain and strike with the weight of an avalanche. The only Strikes you can make are falling stone unarmed attacks. These deal 1d8 bludgeoning damage and have the forceful and unarmed traits.

    While in Mountain Stance, you gain a +4 bonus to AC and a +2 bonus to any defenses against being Shoved or Tripped. However, you don't add your Agility to your AC, and your Speed is reduced by 5 feet.

Power Attack:
  tier: Novice
  type: 2-Action
  traits: [Flourish]
  effect:
    You unleash a particularly powerful attack that clobbers your foe but
    leaves you a bit unsteady. Make a melee Strike (which counts as two
    attacks when calculating your MAP). If this Strike hits, you deal an extra
    die of weapon damage.

Rage:
  tier: Novice
  type: 1-Action
  brief: You enter a furious rage, gaining offensive power at the cost of defense
  traits: [Concentrate, Emotion, Encounter, Mental]
  tags:
    duration:
      1 minute, until you can't sense any enemies, or until you fall unconscious
  effect:
    You tap into your inner fury and begin raging. You gain temporary HP equal
    to Level + Strength. While raging, you deal 2 additional damage with melee
    strikes, you take a -1 penalty to AC, and you can't use actions with <span
    class="trait">Concentrate</span> unless they also have <span
    class="trait">Rage</span>.

Sudden Charge:
  tier: Novice
  type: 2-Action
  traits: [Flourish, Open]
  effect:
    With a quick sprint, you dash up to your foe and swing. Stride twice. If

    melee Strike against that enemy.

Swipe:
  tier: Novice
  type: 2-Action
  traits: [Flourish]
  effect:
    You make a wide, arcing swing. Make a single melee Strike and compare the attack roll result to the ACs of up to two foes, each of whom must be within your melee reach and adjacent to the other. Roll damage only once and apply it to each creature you hit. A Swipe counts a two attacks for MAP. If you're using a weapon with the sweep trait, its modifier applies to all your Swipe attacks.

Cleave:
  tier: Veteran
  type: Reaction
  traits: [Rage]
  tags:
    trigger: Your melee Strike kills a creature or knocks it unconscious, and another foe is adjacent to that creature

Furious Focus:
  tier: Veteran
  type: Passive
  tags:
    prerequisites: Power Attack
  effect:
    You've learned to maintain your balance even when swinging furiously. When you make a Power Attack with a melee weapon you're wielding in two hands, it counts as one attack toward MAP instead of two.

  tier: Veteran
  type: 1-Action
  traits: [Polymorph, Rage]
  tags:

Savage Critical:
  tier: Epic
  type: Passive

    The wounds you inflict are greivous. When you Strike, you critically succeed if you roll a 19 on the die as long as that result is a success.
