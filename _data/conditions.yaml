Blinded: You can't see. All normal terrain is difficult terrain to you. You can't detect anything using vision. You automatically critically fail {Perception} rolls that require you to be able to see. If vision is your only precise sense, you're flat-footed, and you take a -4 penalty to Perception rolls and attack rolls. Blinded doesn't stack with {dazzled}.

Dazzled: Your eyes are overstimulated. If vision is your only precise sense, you take a -2 penalty to {Perception} rolls and attack rolls.

Downed: You are severely injured and are barely able to move. You have the {prone} and {slowed} 2 conditions, and you cannot stand up. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.

Dying: You are bleeding out or otherwise at death's door. The dying condition is always associated with a value from 1 to 4. If you reach dying 4, you die. At the start of each of your turns while you have this condition, you must make a [death save](combat-rules.html#death-save). Your dying condition increases by 1 if you take damage while dying, or by 2 if you take damage from an enemy's critical hit or a critical failure on your save. This condition ends if your HP goes above 0.

Flat-footed: You're distracted or otherwise unable to focus your full attention on defense. You take a -2 penalty to AC.

Grabbed: You're held in place by another creature, giving you the {flat-footed} and {immobilized} conditions.

Immobilized: You can't use any power with the {% trait Move %} trait. If you're immobilized by something holding you in place and an external force would move you out of your space, the force must succeed at a check against the DC of the effect holding you.

Paralyzed: Your body is frozen in place. You have the {flat-footed} condition and can't use any powers. Your senses still function, but only in the areas you can perceive without moving your body.

Prone: You're lying on the ground. You are {flat-footed} and take a -2 penalty to attack rolls. The only {% trait Move %} power you can use while you're prone are {Stand} and {Stride}, and you can only move by crawling. You can {Stand} up to end the prone condition.

Quickened: You have more actions. You gain 1 additional action at the start of your turn each round.

Restrained: You're tied up and can barely move, or a creature has you pinned. You have the {flat-footed} and {immobilized} conditions, and you can't use any powers with the {% trait Attack %} or {% trait Manipulate %} traits except to attempt to {Escape} or {Force Open} your bonds.

Slowed: You have fewer actions. The slowed condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number of actions you regain by X.

Stunned: You've become senseless. You can't act while stunned. The stunned condition is always associated with a value X. When you regain your actions at the start of your turn, reduce the number you regain by X, then reduce X by the number of actions you lost. For example, if you were stunned 4, you would lose all 3 of your actions on your turn, reducing you to stunned 1; on your next turn, you would lose 1 more action, and then be able to use your remaining 2 actions normally. Stunned doesn't stack with {slowed}.

Unconscious: You're sleeping, or you've been knocked out. You can't act. You take a -4 penalty to AC and {Reflex} saves, and you have the {blinded} and {flat-footed} conditions. You fall {prone} and drop items you are wielding or holding. Taking damage, being affected by a spell, or hearing a loud noise usually ends this condition.
