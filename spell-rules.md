Following are more advanced rules related to spells.

## The {% trait Spell %} trait

A power with the {% trait Spell %} trait is called a **spell**. All spells have the {% trait Concentrate %} and {% trait Manipulate %} traits. Using such a power is called **casting** the spell. Casting a spell requires speaking a command phrase and making hand gestures, which usually make it obvious that you are casting a spell.

## Spell Properties

Most spells have a **cost** in Mana. You must pay this amount of Mana when you cast the spell. If you run out of Mana, you can pay this cost from your HP instead; if you do, your current and maximum HP both decrease by the remaining cost. If this decreases your maximum HP to 0, you die. Your maximum HP returns to normal on an 8-hour rest.

Most spells have a **range** in feet. If the spell doesn't list a target, it affects one creature you can see within range. If the spell lists an area, the area is centered on a point you can see within range.

## Heightening Spells

You can **heighten** some spells to increase their effect, at the cost of paying more Mana to use the spell. When you cast a spell, you can choose to pay more Mana than the listed cost, up to a maximum Mana cost of Prof + your level in the spell's school.

If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (per +X Mana)**, then for each X Mana you pay above the base cost, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's description has an entry that reads **Heightened (total X Mana)**, then if you pay a total of at least X mana, the effect is modified as listed. If a spell's descriptions has multiple **Heightened** enties, then all of them apply.
