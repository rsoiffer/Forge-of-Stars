Here are some important factions in the setting.

## Arcanists
The arcanists are magical researchers who use science and experiementation to try to uncover the true nature of magic. The arcanists are united by a common quest to discover the truth of the universe and to share it with others. Many arcanists hold jobs as university faculty, so that some universities have a Department of Arcana. Arcanists are also found in corporate and government research labs. Arcanist adventurers might be travelling the galaxy in search of novel phenomena or magical secrets.

### Arcanist subgroups:
* Kamino Institute of Biomancy
* University of Coruscant

## Crime Syndicates
The crime syndicates are group of loosely aligned criminal organizations. They operate outside of the influence of the Empire, controlling or terrorizing worlds across the Outer Rim. Some crime syndicates run the drug and slave trades, some smuggle goods between planets, and others pirate merchant spaceships. Syndicate adventurers could be trying to pull off ever larger heists or could be on the run from their dark pasts.

### Crime syndicate subgroups:
* Hutt Cartel
* Ravagers

## Cult Mechanicus
The Cult Mechanicus is a religious organization that worships technology. Members believe that modern technology only functions by the grace of the machine spirits, the greatest of which is a diety called the Machine God or the Omnissiah. Although most folk look down the Cult's beliefs, everyone acknowledges their mechanical skill. Mechanicus adventurers could be mercenary engineers, or they could be trying to spread the word of their faith.

### Cult Mechanicus subgroups:
* Cybernetic Enhancers
* Technomancers

## Humanitarian Church
The Humanitarian Church believes in the inherent abilities of mankind, and in the our duty to be compassionate and charitable towards those less fortunate. Most humanitarians extend this compassion to alien races, but a xenophobic faction of the Church denies that aliens have these rights. Recently, the Empire made Humanitarianism the official religion and proclaimed the emperor as the God-Emperor of Mankind, drawing from the Church's traditional God of Mankind. Humanitarian adventurers likely believe in charity towards all races, travelling to do as much good as they can.

### Humanitarian Church subgroups:
* Humanitarian Clerics
* Inquisitors
* Salvation Army

## Imperial Military
The Imperial military works to defend the Empire from threats, both internal and external. By far the strongest military in the galaxy, the Imperial military commands fleets of giant starships, hordes of powerful tanks, and untold millions of ground soldiers. As large as they are, the galaxy is larger, and the Imperial military is constantly stretched thin guarding the hundreds of thousands of worlds in the Empire. Imperial military adventurers are probably retired veterans or defectors who reject the Empire's authoritarianism.

### Imperial military subgroups:
* Imperial Guard
* Space Marines
* Stormtroopers

## Jedi Order
The Jedi Order is a group of sages and mystics who work to promote peace and harmony throughout the galaxy. Members believe in the Jedi religion, which asserts the existence of the Force, a invisble field of energy of permeates all living things. Powerful Jedi are able to harness the Force to perform magical and martial feats. The Jedi are persecuted by the Empire due to their ties to the Rebel Alliance. Jedi adventurers probably work to promote peace and end wars throughout the galaxy.

### Jedi Order subgroups:
* Consulars
* Guardians

## Librarians
The Librarians are an order of sorcerers who safeguard hidden temples and libraries. The normally secretive monks are publicly known for their efforts to defeat and contain evil spirits rampaging through populated worlds. Rumor has it that their monastic libraries hold secrets so dark that the universe would be destroyed if they were ever brought to light. Librarian adventures might be knowledge-seekers sent to learn about the universe, or they might be protectors sent to interfere with dangerous magic rituals.

### Librarian subgroups:
* Grimm Hunters
* Violet Nebula Sanctum

## Neoshamans
Neoshamans are a diverse group of people who share the belief that the natural world is full of spirits to which we should pay respect. Some neoshamans focus on the spirits within animals and plants, while others see spirits in planets, moons, and even stars. Many neoshamans have magical abilities to manifest spirits in the world. Neoshaman adventurers could be wardens of nature, working to protect the environment from misuse.

### Neoshaman subgroups:
* Environmentalists
* Star Shamans

## Rebel Alliance
The Rebel Alliance is an alliance between several groups of anti-Empire guerillas that independently began working to overthrow the Empire. Considered terrorists by the Empire, rebels must hide in secret bases in the Outer Rim to avoid annihilation. The Rebel Alliance has perpetrated many large-scale attacks against the Imperial military, destroying starships and military bases. Rebel adventurers might be exploring the galaxy to recruit new members and overthrow Imperial oppression everywhere.

### Rebel Alliance subgroups:
* Republicans
* Separatists

## Trade Federation
The Trade Federation is a massive corporate agglomerate that controls interstellar commerce in a large sector of the galaxy. They control the entire chain of production, from resource gathering expeditions, to industrial factory-worlds, to fleets of merchant starships.

Trade Federation adventurers might be prospectors exploring for resource deposites or merchants carrying goods between planets.
