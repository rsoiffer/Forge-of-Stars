Following are rules for interacting with the world.

## Resting

The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.

If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any {% trait Encounter %} powers you have expended, and your recover all of your Mana. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any {% trait Daily %} powers you have expended.

## Inspiration

The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration.

A player can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll that any character makes. You must use the new roll, and you can't spend inspiration to reroll the die a second time.

## NPC Attitude

What a non-player character thinks of the party will greatly affect how they interact with the players. NPCs have an **attitude** towards the party, which is one of the following values:

Helpful
: The creature actively wishes to aid you, as long as doing so doesn't go against its own goals or hurt its quality of life

Friendly
: The creature likes you, and will generally agree to simple and easy requests

Indifferent
: The creature doesn't know you, or doesn't care about you one way or the other

Unfriendly
: The creature dislikes and distrusts you, and won't agree to any of your requests

Hostile
: The creature actively wishes to harm you, and might attack you or otherwise try to get in your way

Most NPCs start as indifferent towards the party. A creature you're fighting is almost always hostile towards you. Aggressive or hurtful actions towards an NPC will greatly worsen their attitude towards you, while generous or kind actions towards an NPC might improve their attitude towards you.

## Currency

The approximate total wealth of a character of level X should be roughly 4,000 cred * 1.5^X. Thus a level 1 character should start with approximately 6,000 cred, while a level 17 character should have approximately 4,000,000 cred worth of items.

An item generally sells for half the cost of buying the item (factoring in taxes, the item being used, retailer markups, and so on). If the item is stolen, in terrible condition, or otherwise hard to sell, it sells for roughly one tenth of the cost of buying the item.
