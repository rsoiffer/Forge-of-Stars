Following are rules for interacting with the world.

## Inspiration

The GM is encouraged to reward players for good roleplaying with a mechanic called inspiration. Whenever the GM thinks a player did something cool or immersive, the GM should give that player a point of inspiration.

A player can spend a point of inspiration to reroll any skill roll that any character makes. You must use the new roll, and you can't spend inspiration to reroll the die a second time.

## Treasure

The approximate total wealth of a character of level X should be roughly 4,000 cred * 1.5^X. Thus a level 1 character should start with approximately 6,000 cred, while a level 17 character should have approximately 4,000,000 cred worth of items.

Selling an item generally gets you an amount of money equal to half the cost of buying the item (factoring in taxes, the item being used, retailer markups, and so on). If the item is stolen, in terrible condition, or otherwise hard to sell, you get an amount of money equal to one tenth of the cost of buying the item.

## Movement Details

If you're using a grid during combat, one square generally corresponds to 5 feet. Because moving diagonally covers more ground, the first square of diagonal movement in a turn counts as 5 feet, the second counts as 10 feet, and further squares alternate between the two.

While you're climbing, swimming, or crawling, your Speed is halved. Climbing a vertical surface or swimming in rough water usually requires an Athletics roll.

### Difficult Terrain

Some terrain, like dense thorn bushes, uneven rocks, or slippery ice, is very difficult to move through. Your Speed is halved while you move through difficult terrain.

Extremely dangerous terrain, such as a grease spill or a tightrope, can be even more difficult to move across. Whenever you attempt to move, the GM might ask you to make an Acrobatics roll to avoid falling prone.

### Falling

If there is nothing supporting your character, you fall. You fall up to 500 feet per round. When you fall 10 or more feet, you take 1d6 damage for each 10 feet you fall, up to a cap of 50d6 damage. The number of dice is reduced by half if you fall onto a soft surface, such as a pile of hay or a pool of water. You land prone if you take any damage from a fall.

## Resting

The best way to recover from difficult combats is to spend some time resting. The benefits you gain from a rest depend on the length of the rest. You can perform light activity during a rest, such as standing guard, setting up camp, or eating a meal.

If you take a 5-minute rest, you recover the ability to use any Encounter powers you have expended, and your recover all of your Mana. If you take a 1-hour rest, you heal HP equal to half of your maximum HP (this effect can only occur once per day). If you take an 8-hour rest, during which you get at least 5 hours of sleep, you heal to full HP, and you recover the ability to use any Daily powers you have expended.
